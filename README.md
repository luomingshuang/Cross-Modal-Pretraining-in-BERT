# Cross-Modal Pretraining in BERT[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

I just want to have a collection of works (including papers and codes) about the cross-modal pretraining in BERT. So I will try my best to record the papers and codes in these years. If you have any other news can enrich and improve this page, I am very happy to receive your messages. Hope my work can help you!

#### Why cross-modal pretraining in BERT?
BERT has been a very popular model architecture in AI community. 
* Strong long sequence modeling capabilities
* Self attention mechanism

Cross-modal learning mechanism is more similar to the learning method of the human brain.
